.TH SENSOR-DHT11 1 "January 2026" "sensor-dht11 2.1.0" "Wildlife Systems"
.SH NAME
sensor-dht11 \- read DHT11 sensors attached to a WildlifeSystems node
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sensor-dht11
.RI [ command ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sensor-dht11
reads temperature and humidity data from DHT11 sensors attached to the Raspberry Pi
using libgpiod for GPIO bit-banging.
.PP
This is a lightweight C implementation that outputs sensor readings in JSON format
compatible with WildlifeSystems. Each reading includes a Unix timestamp indicating
when the sensor was read.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B \-\-version, \-v, version
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.B temperature
Output only temperature readings.
.TP
.B humidity
Output only humidity readings.
.TP
.B internal
Output only readings from sensors marked as internal in the configuration.
Only runs sensors that are configured with "internal": true.
.TP
.B external
Output only readings from sensors marked as external in the configuration.
Only runs sensors that are configured with "internal": false.
.TP
.B list
List available sensor types (temperature, humidity).
.TP
.B identify
Exit with code 60 for sensor identification.
.TP
.B all
Output all sensor readings (default if no command given).
.SH CONFIGURATION
The configuration file
.I /etc/ws/sensors/dht11.json
is a JSON array of sensor objects. Each sensor object supports the following fields:
.TP
.B pin
GPIO pin number (2-27). Default is 4.
.TP
.B internal
Boolean indicating if the sensor is inside the enclosure. Default is false.
.TP
.B sensor_id
Custom sensor identifier string. Default is derived from the Raspberry Pi serial number.
.TP
.B sensor_name
Custom sensor name for the sensor_name field in JSON output. If not specified,
the default from sc-prototype is used.
.PP
Example configuration:
.PP
.nf
[
  {
    "pin": 4,
    "internal": true,
    "sensor_name": "enclosure_dht11"
  }
]
.fi
.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
The program outputs a JSON array of sensor readings. Each reading includes:
.TP
.B sensor
The sensor type (always "dht11_temperature" or "dht11_humidity").
.TP
.B measures
What is being measured (e.g., "temperature", "humidity").
.TP
.B unit
The unit of measurement (e.g., "Celsius", "percentage").
.TP
.B value
The numeric reading value, or null on error.
.TP
.B internal
Boolean indicating if the sensor is internal.
.TP
.B sensor_id
The sensor identifier.
.TP
.B sensor_name
Custom sensor name from configuration, or default from sc-prototype.
.TP
.B timestamp
Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) when the sensor was read.
.TP
.B error
Error message if reading failed, null otherwise.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/ws/sensors/dht11.json
Configuration file specifying sensor pin, internal flag, sensor_id, and sensor_name.
.TP
.I /dev/gpiochip0
GPIO chip device used for sensor communication.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Success.
.TP
.B 20
Invalid argument.
.TP
.B 60
Identify command executed.
.SH NOTES
This program is designed to be used with the \fBsr\fR program (sensor-read) from WildlifeSystems.
.PP
A watchdog timer (30 seconds) prevents the program from hanging indefinitely if GPIO
operations become unresponsive.
.PP
The binary uses SCHED_FIFO real-time scheduling during GPIO reads to minimise
preemption-related timing failures. The
.B cap_sys_nice
capability is set on the binary at install time.
.PP
GPIO pins are validated to be in the range 2-27 (valid Raspberry Pi GPIO pins).
Invalid pins in the configuration file will be replaced with the default pin (4).
